# PaceBot: Graduate Programs Chatbot with AWS Integration

ðŸŽ“ **PaceBot** is an intelligent conversational assistant designed to help prospective students explore graduate programs at Pace University and apply directly via a chatbot interface. It leverages semantic search and advanced NLP models, integrated seamlessly with AWS services for scalable application management.

## Project Overview

PaceBot allows users to:

- Ask questions about Pace University graduate programs using semantic search powered by Sentence Transformers and ChromaDB.
- Receive contextual answers generated by Google's FLAN-T5 model (retrieval-augmented generation).
- Submit applications by providing personal and educational information.
- Have application data securely stored in AWS DynamoDB via API Gateway and AWS Lambda.

This project demonstrates end-to-end skills in NLP, vector search, cloud integration, and serverless architecture â€” valuable for data science and data engineering roles.

## AWS Integration

The project uses AWS to manage application data with these components:

- **DynamoDB:** NoSQL database storing applicant information.
- **AWS Lambda:** Serverless functions processing incoming application data.
- **API Gateway:** RESTful endpoint exposing Lambda functions for chatbot to send application data securely.

The chatbot sends application details as JSON to API Gateway, which triggers Lambda to write to DynamoDB. This architecture ensures scalability and fault tolerance without managing servers.
